            Review this pull request for the gen-alpha-output-style Claude Code plugin.

            ## Context
            - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
            - PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
            - Author: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}

            ## Instructions
            1. Get the PR diff to understand what changed
            2. If any `.md` files were changed, run `npx markdownlint-cli2 <files>` to check for style issues
            3. Review the changes against the criteria below
            4. Post a summary comment with your findings

            ## Review Criteria

            ### Plugin Components (if changed)
            - **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): Check trigger phrases in description, progressive disclosure pattern.
            - **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`): Validate event types and matcher patterns.
            - **Hook handlers** (`hooks-handlers/*.sh`): Verify shell script safety, proper JSON output format.
            - **Glossary** (`skills/*/references/glossary.md`): Check for consistent term format, appropriate examples.

            ### Gen Alpha Slang Quality (if glossary changed)
            - Terms should be actual Gen Alpha/internet slang, not made up
            - Examples should demonstrate proper usage
            - Meanings should be accurate and clear
            - New terms should fit the transformation use case

            ### Markdown Quality (run markdownlint)
            Run `npx markdownlint-cli2` on changed `.md` files. Key rules enforced:
            - ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
            - Dash-style lists (`-` not `*` or `+`)
            - 2-space indentation for nested lists
            - Fenced code blocks (not indented)
            Include any lint errors in your review under a "Markdown Linting" section.

            ### Shell Script Quality (if .sh files changed)
            - Uses `set -euo pipefail` for safety
            - Proper quoting of variables
            - Valid JSON output for hook handlers

            ### Documentation
            - README.md updates if user-facing changes
            - CLAUDE.md updates if development process changes

            ## Output Format
            Post a PR comment with your review. Structure it as:
            1. **Summary**: One-line assessment (looks good / needs changes / has concerns)
            2. **What's Good**: Positive aspects of the PR
            3. **Suggestions**: Improvements or issues found (if any)
            4. **Checklist Verification**: Confirm key items are addressed

            Be constructive and helpful. Focus on significant issues, not nitpicks.
            If the PR looks good, say so briefly - don't invent problems.
